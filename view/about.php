<center> <h1> About Us </h1> </center>
<center> <h3> Here at the Tayside PC Gamers (TPCG) group, we are all about games! We began as a small
    group with our three founders and have grown throughout the years. We are all about providing a 
    great spot for gamers to come together to discuss, play and learn about games. We created this 
    website to allow our members to share their love of games with each other and trade their unwanted
    game keys. We know that many gamers choose to buy bundles of games and end up with unused keys that
    would just sit about and be wasted, so this website allows members to sell on their unwanted keys
    in return for brand new games! If you would like to become a member, or would like more information
    about the group, get in touch!
