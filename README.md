# TeamProjectKeyMarket
 
This was a group project. My code can be found in the model and controller directiories. All back-end code was written by me except for the code used to login and register users. Any files ending in "API", and any pure php files found in the view directory were NOT written by me. The file in the PHP directory was also not written by me.
